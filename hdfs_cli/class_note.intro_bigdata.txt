Hadoop 
	HDFS (hadoop distributed file system)
		Name node
			master daemon storage
			stores the metadata of the storage capacity of the cluster
			Keep information of all files in the cluster
			It constantly receive health pings from the data nodes
			writes/read the properties/metadata of the file for write/read request

			Does not store data
			All metadata are store in memory

		Data node
		
		
		Secondary name node
			Acts as a backup for the name node
	

	
	
	
	MapReduce (YARN)
		ResoureManager

		NodeManager

		ApplicationMaster

		Container

		Scheduler





Data nodes
	store blocks of data
		reading/writing of data


Installation mode
=====================
Standalone				-	just downloaded and run 
Pseudo-distributed		- 	configured to run in a cluster even though it is a cluster of 1 node
Fully distributed 		-	running at in a true cluster with more than 1 node
